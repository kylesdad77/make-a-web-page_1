      <h4 id="internet">How the internet works</h4>
      <p>A user connects to the internet with their computer. 
      The internet is basically a bunch of computers connected
      to servers. The internet sends an <i>HTTP</i> signal to the servers. The servers send the info back to the computer.
      A web browser like <i>I.E., Firefox</i> or <i>Google Chrome,</i> then turns the HTML text
      into a docutment that can be viewed on your monitor. The internet is basically a collection of HTML text documents.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
      <h4 id="basic">Basics of HTML</h4>
        <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is the programming language that allows someone to write code for web pages. This is the "heart" of the web. It is made up of text content. <em>What you see.</em> It is also made up of markup. <em>What it looks like.</em> You can reference other documents, create links to other web pages and imbed videos.
        </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h4 id="html">HTML Markup</h4>
    <p>There are many tags that can change the look of your webpage. A tag looks like this: <i>(opening tag name, contents, closing tag name)</i> This is done with &#60; and &#62; instead of ( ) of course. 
    A few of the tags consist of the em tag which <em>italicizes</em> text. The b tag which <b>bolds</b> text. There is also a u tag which <u>underlines</u> text. There are just a few of the many tags available in the HTML language. You can also assign attributes which are values that can link certain web pages to text. Click <a href="udacity.com">here</a> to go to Udacity.com. This is an "a" tag which are anchors for linking webpages.
    </p>
 </div>
<div class="section"><h4 id="stupid">Computers are stupid?</h4>
    <p>I always thought computers were smart until I learned a neat little tidbit from this course. Computers can only do what we tell them to do. We must program them to do the tasks which we require and we must program them correctly. One syntax error can cause an entire program to not function. Syntax errors and simply errors in what was entered into the code.</p>
 </div>
<div class="section"><h4 id="whitespace">Whitespace</h4>
    <p>White space refers to the way text looks on a webpage when it is entered as HTML. The text will form one long line without proper formatting. A br tag can be used to add a <br>line break. This is a void tag meaning it does not require a closing tag. This is referred to as an "inline" element. It creates changes on a line without creating a box.</p> 
    <p>The p tags creats new paragraphs. This is referred to as a "block" element. It creates an invisible box around the text that has actual height and width.</p>
 </div>
<div class="section"><h3 class="header" id="headtwo">Lesson 2: Creating a structured document with HTML</h3>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h4 id="stages">Stages of Expertise</h4>
      <p>There are four stages of expertise when it comes to learning. They are ignorance, awareness, ability and expert.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Ignorance</i> - You have not acquired any knowledge regarding a specific topic.
      <li><i>Awareness</i> - You have gained some knowledge, but are not quite yet ready to use that knowledge.
      <li><i>Ability</i> - Your knowledge has given you the ability to use them in a correct way.
      <li><i>Expert</i> - Now you can do what needs to be done without thinking twice about it. You can speak another language, drive a car, or write code.</ul>
      <p>Frustration will occur along your path to knowledge. Things don't always work the first time around and practice is always needed to get better at something. You can Google any answer you need when it comes to programming. No need to quite. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h4 id="structure">HTML Structure and Style</h4>
    <p>HTML is the language of web page structure. CSS is the language of web page style. There is also JS, but we will not be gettig much into that in this nanodegree. A web browswer sees HTML as a DOM (document object model). Everything is divided into boxes. This is shown as a "tree-like" structure when writing code. These boxes are divided with the "div" tag.</p>
 </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h3 class="header" id="headthree">Lesson 3: Adding CSS style to your HTML sturcture</h3>
  </div> 
      <div class="section"><h4 id="repitition">Avoiding repitition</h4>
        <p>In order to avoid a lot of repitition when adding style you can link a style sheet to your html. First, you would creat a new style.css sheet in a folder that you can easily locate. Then, link the sheet to your html with a "link" tag. For example: (link rel="stylesheet" type ="text/css" href="style.css") CSS stands for cascading style sheets. There are many things you can do with CSS. You can change the font type, style, size, weight, color, ect.
        </p>
        <p>The following is an example of how you can change background color with CSS.
        h1 { background-color: black; } In this example, h1 refers to the heading selected and is known as the "selector." Background-color: black; is a "declaration." Background-color is a "property" and black is a "value."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><h4 id="threeways">Three ways to include CSS styling in your webpage</h4>
        There are three ways that you can use CSS to make your webpage more inviting and more professional. They are:
      <ol>
        <li>Write the CSS in the head of your HTML document. This is good for small projects. Just include all of your CSS code right inside of your head tag.</li>
        <li>Link your HTML to a CSS file. This is your best bet when working on larger projects. You simply link to a style sheet as described above.</li>
        <li>Write your style inline with your HTML. You want to avoid doing this. It takes much longer and leads to repitition.</li>
      </ol></div>
